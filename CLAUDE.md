## Skill Graph & Orchestrator

The orchestrator (`/pm`) uses `pm-orchestrator/skill-graph.yaml` to understand dependencies between skills. When running the orchestrator:

1. Read the skill graph to understand phase ordering and skill dependencies
2. Check for `project-state.md` in the workspace for current project state
3. Look in `Project Context/production-version/product-docs/` for existing artifacts and data

## Project Context

Real Pika product data lives in `Project Context/production-version/product-docs/`:
- `overview/` — Product direction and user journey
- `insight hub/user-feedback/` — User feedback CSVs and analysis
- `insight hub/market-research/` — Survey and interview data
- `insight hub/feature-report/` — Feature performance reports
- `insight hub/insight/` — Strategic documents (OST, prioritization, OKRs)
- `insight hub/proposals/` — Feature proposals and roadmaps

When running any skill, check this directory for relevant context to inject.

## Output Convention

Save skill outputs as markdown files. Use the naming convention specified in each skill's output format section (e.g., `learning-objectives-[feature].md`, `compliance-audit-[product].md`).
